# -Document-search-engine-using-BERT-cdQA-system


Thanks to the advancement in NLP technology, with a few lines of code we can extract information from a database. BERT QA systems have two different kinds of systems: open-domain QA (ODQA) systems and closed-domain QA (CDQA) systems. It is an easy implementation and deployment of Question-Answering systems in Python. It uses a pipeline with classical Information Retrieval techniques and the Deep Learning model BERT. In this lesson, we will learn how to make query from a list of documents(reports) by using the cdQA system

Lesson Goals

In this lesson, we will learn how to make query from a list of document(reports) by using The cdQA architecture which is based on two main components: the Retriever and the Reader. The history of Machine Comprehension (MC) has its origins along with the birth of first concepts in Artificial Intelligence (AI). QA system is a two different kind system Open domain and close domain so today we will learn the close domain system.


Prerequests


pip install cdqa
Make sure to create a new directory and new environment
Please be aware that model fine-tuning should be performed using GPU as the BERT model is too large to be trained with CPU. use GCP
